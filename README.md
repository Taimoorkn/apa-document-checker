DO NOT GUESS THINGS, DO NOT ASSUME THINGS WHEN CHECKING AND UPDATING CODE, DO NOT MAKE MISTAKES, FACT CHECK YOUR UPDATES AND FINDINGS, REVISIT CODE AND FILES REPEATEDLY TO UNDERSTAND THEM WHEN DEBUGGING ISSUES, MAKING UPDATES AND WHEN CHECKING YOUR OWN IMPLMENTATIONS, THAT INCLUDES FUNCTION CALLS, OBJECT STRUCTURE, OBJEACT AND PROPS PASSING AND IMPORTS.\
DO NOT RUSH




Yes, continue with your proposed solution.

Follow these principles throughout the entire implementation:

DO NOT GUESS OR ASSUME. ALWAYS FACT-CHECK YOUR UPDATES AND FINDINGS. REVISIT THE CODE AND FILES REPEATEDLY UNTIL YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND THEM — ESPECIALLY WHEN DEBUGGING, UPDATING, OR CHECKING YOUR OWN IMPLEMENTATIONS. THIS INCLUDES VERIFYING FUNCTION CALLS, OBJECT STRUCTURES, PROP PASSING, AND IMPORTS. TAKE YOUR TIME AND DO NOT RUSH.

MAINTAIN FORMATTING FIDELITY. FORMATTING IS CRUCIAL FOR APA DOCUMENTS. ENSURE THAT BOLD, ITALICS, FONT STYLES, HEADINGS, AND ALL OTHER VISUAL ELEMENTS ARE PRESERVED ACCURATELY. DO NOT STRIP OR SIMPLIFY FORMATTING.

Clean old code as you make changes. Remove legacy or unused parts instead of leaving them behind.





















now answer with proper reasoning and proof the following questions and dont use any code examples in your answer, just text\
  \
  is the currect implementation great interms of document editing, side by side analysis, optimizations, issue finding and marking?\
  im trying to make a website that is like grammerly in terms of ux and performance but at a much much smaller scale.\
  \
  is this project scalable? is the architecture right? is the implementation and flow of the project correct? especially in terms of document editing in real time?\   
  \
  you may perform websearch to improve your response





analyze the complete codebase in the server/ and src/ directories, ALL FOLDERS AND ALL FILES IN EACH DIRECTORY, FOLDER, SUBFOLDER.
  Once you've thoroughly reviewed all folders and files, create a comprehensive Markdown document that explains the entire project workflow from start to finish —     
  beginning when a user uploads a document through to the final output/result.
  Required Elements:

  Complete end-to-end flow diagram using proper file paths (e.g., src/components/Upload.jsx, server/routes/process.js)
  Exact function names and their locations
  Visual flow indicators (arrows: →, ↓, <-) showing the complete sequence of operations
  Data structures being passed between functions (objects, props, parameters, API responses)
  Technical implementation details at each stage (API calls, data processing, storage, retrieval, rendering)

  Structure:

  Overview - High-level summary of what the entire application does
  Complete Workflow - Detailed step-by-step breakdown:

  Document upload initiation
  Backend processing and storage
  Data transformation/analysis
  Database operations
  Result generation
  Display/output to user


  Component Analysis - Each file/function's role in the pipeline
  Data Flow Mapping - Track data objects through the entire system with their structure and contents
  Technical Architecture - How all pieces connect (frontend ↔ backend ↔ database ↔ external services)

  Create this as a well-structured .md artifact that serves as complete technical documentation for the entire application flow.



THis is my current setup :
APA Document Checker - Technical Summary

  What It Does

  An academic writing assistant that validates Word documents (.docx) against APA 7th edition guidelines. Students and researchers upload their papers and get instant feedback on formatting, citations,
  structure, and writing quality with automated fixes for common issues.

  How It Works

  Document Processing Flow

  1. Upload: User uploads .docx file through web interface
  2. Server Processing: LibreOffice converts document to HTML while preserving rich formatting data
  3. Analysis: Dual-layer validation system checks document:
    - Rule-based: Validates against 50+ specific APA requirements
    - AI-powered: Analyzes content quality and academic tone (optional)
  4. Interactive Feedback: Issues displayed in categorized panels with clickable highlighting
  5. Auto-Fix: One-click fixes for common formatting issues by modifying the original document
