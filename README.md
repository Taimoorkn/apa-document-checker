 Perfect! Now I've found the smoking gun. Let me check one more critical piece - what happens after auto-save completes in the store:

● Critical Issues Found

  I've identified multiple architectural problems causing your terrible editor experience:

  🔴 PRIMARY ISSUE: Version Increment in Auto-Save Triggers Full Document Refresh

  Location: DocumentService.js:1121-1122
  // Update local state
  documentModel.version++;
  documentModel.lastModified = Date.now();

  The Problem Flow:
  1. User types → Auto-save triggered (3s debounce)
  2. Auto-save completes → increments documentModel.version
  3. Store triggers analysis (line 738: scheduleIncrementalAnalysis(100))
  4. Analysis completes → emits 'analysisComplete' event
  5. Editor hook listens to 'analysisComplete' → calls updateIssueHighlights()
  6. BUT WORSE: The version increment causes issues...

  Let me check what triggers the needsSync flag:

● Search(pattern: "needsSync.*true", path: "src", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 4 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Now I can see the complete picture. Let me write my analysis:

● Root Cause Analysis

  I've identified 3 critical architectural flaws causing your editor to feel broken:

  🔴 CRITICAL FLAW #1: Auto-Save Increments Version (Unnecessary)

  File: src/services/DocumentService.js:1121-1122

  // Update local state
  documentModel.version++;  // ❌ THIS IS WRONG
  documentModel.lastModified = Date.now();

  Why this is wrong:
  - Auto-save should NOT increment version
  - Version should only increment when document content changes (user edits)
  - Auto-save is just persisting existing changes to the database
  - This version increment serves no purpose and causes confusion

  ---
  🔴 CRITICAL FLAW #2: Analysis After EVERY Auto-Save

  File: src/store/unifiedDocumentStore.js:738

  // Trigger fast analysis after save (100ms delay)
  get().scheduleIncrementalAnalysis(100);  // ❌ THIS IS WRONG

  Why this is wrong:
  - Analysis already happens when user edits (line 548 in store, triggered by syncWithEditor)
  - Running analysis AGAIN after auto-save is redundant and wasteful
  - This causes the document to be re-analyzed even though nothing changed
  - User flow: Type → Analysis scheduled (1s) → Auto-save (3s) → Analysis AGAIN (100ms) ❌

  Correct flow should be:
  - Type → Sync to model → Analysis scheduled (1s) → Auto-save (3s) → DONE ✅

  ---
  🔴 CRITICAL FLAW #3: Editor Sync Mechanism is Fragile

  File: src/hooks/useUnifiedDocumentEditor.js:258-277

  // Update editor content without triggering onUpdate
  await new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (editor && !editor.isDestroyed) {
        editor.commands.setContent(editorContent, false, {  // ❌ FULL CONTENT REPLACEMENT
          preserveWhitespace: true
        });

  Why this is problematic:
  - setContent() replaces the entire document
  - This destroys cursor position and scroll position
  - Even with emitUpdate: false, the selection is lost
  - This happens when:
    - Fix is applied (needsSync = true)
    - Document restored from snapshot
    - Any time needsSync is set to true

  ---
  The Actual User Experience Flow (BROKEN)

  1. User types: "Hello world"
     ↓
  2. 300ms later: syncWithEditor() updates DocumentModel
     ↓
  3. 1s later: Analysis scheduled and runs
     ↓
  4. 3s after typing stopped: Auto-save triggers
     ↓
  5. Auto-save completes:
     - Increments documentModel.version (WRONG!)
     - Triggers ANOTHER analysis (WRONG!)
     ↓
  6. Analysis completes:
     - Emits 'analysisComplete' event
     - updateIssueHighlights() is called
     ↓
  7. Result: Editor flickers, highlights update, but cursor/scroll OK (just wasteful)

  BUT WHEN A FIX IS APPLIED:
  1. User clicks "Apply Fix"
     ↓
  2. Fix applied → sets needsSync = true
     ↓
  3. Editor hook sees needsSync = true
     ↓
  4. syncEditorFromModel() is called
     ↓
  5. editor.commands.setContent() REPLACES ENTIRE DOCUMENT  ← 💥 CURSOR/SCROLL LOST
     ↓
  6. User gets scrolled to top, cursor lost

  Solutions

  Fix #1: Remove Version Increment from Auto-Save

  File: src/services/DocumentService.js:1121-1122

  // BEFORE (WRONG):
  documentModel.version++;
  documentModel.lastModified = Date.now();

  // AFTER (CORRECT):
  // Don't increment version - auto-save doesn't change content
  documentModel.lastModified = Date.now();

  ---
  Fix #2: Remove Redundant Analysis After Auto-Save

  File: src/store/unifiedDocumentStore.js:736-739

  // BEFORE (WRONG):
  console.log('✅ Auto-save completed successfully');

  // Trigger fast analysis after save (100ms delay)
  get().scheduleIncrementalAnalysis(100);

  // AFTER (CORRECT):
  console.log('✅ Auto-save completed successfully');
  // Analysis already happened when user edited - no need to re-analyze

  ---
  Fix #3: Preserve Cursor and Scroll Position During Editor Sync

  File: src/hooks/useUnifiedDocumentEditor.js:220-292

  This is more complex. We need to:
  1. Save cursor position before sync
  2. Replace content
  3. Restore cursor position after sync

  const syncEditorFromModel = useCallback(async () => {
    if (!editor || !documentModel) {
      if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
        console.warn('⚠️ Cannot sync: missing editor or document model', {
          hasEditor: !!editor,
          hasDocumentModel: !!documentModel
        });
      }
      return;
    }

    // If already syncing, wait and retry
    if (isSyncing) {
      if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
        console.log('⏳ Sync in progress, queuing retry...');
      }
      setTimeout(() => syncEditorFromModelRef.current?.(), 200);
      return;
    }

    setIsSyncing(true);
    isInternalUpdateRef.current = true;

    try {
      const editorContent = getEditorContent();

      if (!editorContent) {
        console.warn('⚠️ No editor content from document model');
        return;
      }

      // 🆕 SAVE CURSOR POSITION AND SCROLL
      const { from, to } = editor.state.selection;
      const scrollContainer = editor.view.dom.closest('.overflow-auto') || editor.view.dom.parentElement;
      const scrollTop = scrollContainer?.scrollTop || 0;
      const scrollLeft = scrollContainer?.scrollLeft || 0;

      if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
        console.log('📥 Syncing editor from document model...', {
          documentVersion: documentModel.version,
          paragraphCount: editorContent?.content?.length || 0,
          savedCursor: { from, to },
          savedScroll: { scrollTop, scrollLeft }
        });
      }

      // Update editor content without triggering onUpdate
      await new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          if (editor && !editor.isDestroyed) {
            editor.commands.setContent(editorContent, false, {
              preserveWhitespace: true
            });

            // 🆕 RESTORE CURSOR POSITION
            setTimeout(() => {
              if (editor && !editor.isDestroyed) {
                try {
                  // Validate cursor position is still valid
                  const docSize = editor.state.doc.content.size;
                  const validFrom = Math.min(from, docSize - 1);
                  const validTo = Math.min(to, docSize - 1);

                  if (validFrom >= 0 && validTo >= 0) {
                    editor.commands.setTextSelection({ from: validFrom, to: validTo });
                  }

                  // 🆕 RESTORE SCROLL POSITION
                  if (scrollContainer) {
                    scrollContainer.scrollTop = scrollTop;
                    scrollContainer.scrollLeft = scrollLeft;
                  }

                  // Update issue highlights
                  updateIssueHighlights();
                } catch (error) {
                  console.warn('Could not restore cursor position:', error);
                }
              }
              resolve();
            }, 100);
          } else {
            resolve();
          }
        }, 50);
      });

      lastContentRef.current = JSON.stringify(editorContent);

      if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
        console.log('✅ Editor synced from model (cursor/scroll preserved)');
      }

    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error syncing editor from model:', error);
      setEditorError(error);
    } finally {
      isInternalUpdateRef.current = false;
      setIsSyncing(false);
    }
  }, [editor, documentModel, getEditorContent, isSyncing, updateIssueHighlights]);

  Let me implement these fixes:




































  ● Code Audit Summary: Real-Time Document Editor with Analysis & Auto-Save

  Architectural Goal:

  Build a seamless real-time DOCX editor with live APA analysis, issue highlighting, auto-save to Supabase, and fix application—all without disrupting the user's editing flow (cursor
   position, scroll position, or visual stability).

  Fundamental Architectural Flaws Discovered:

  1. State Management Anti-Pattern (Root Cause)
  - Zustand store triggers ALL subscribers on ANY set() call, regardless of selector specificity
  - Background operations (analysis, auto-save) were updating UI state, causing 5+ re-renders per edit
  - Every re-render resets scroll position and causes visual disruption
  - Attempted Fix: Moved isAnalyzing out of Zustand → Reduced re-renders but broke other functionality

  2. Dual Source of Truth Problem
  - DocumentModel holds canonical data, but editor has its own Tiptap JSON state
  - After fixes, content cache (editorState.content) becomes stale
  - getEditorContent() returns cached version instead of regenerating from updated DocumentModel
  - Attempted Fix: Clear content cache → Causes full document replacement, losing formatting

  3. Bidirectional Sync Hell
  - Editor changes → sync to DocumentModel → trigger analysis → update issues → re-render editor
  - Fix applied → update DocumentModel → clear cache → sync back to editor → replace content → formatting corrupted
  - No incremental update mechanism—always full document replacement via setContent()
  - Attempted Fix: Preserve cursor/scroll during sync → Works but doesn't prevent content replacement

  4. Analysis-Highlighting Disconnect
  - Issues are updated in DocumentModel, but highlights use different text matching logic
  - After analysis, highlights don't align with new issues due to async timing
  - Issue signature changes (169→154 issues) causing double highlight updates
  - Attempted Fix: Debounce highlight updates → Doesn't solve root async race condition

  5. Fix Application Destroys Formatting
  - Client-side text fixes update paragraph text but lose run-level formatting (font, size, color)
  - Line 621-638 in DocumentService: Creates single run with first run's formatting, discards others
  - Tiptap's setContent() receives simplified JSON without original formatting details
  - Attempted Fix: None attempted—this is a data model limitation

  What Didn't Work:

  1. ❌ Removing version increment from auto-save (helps but doesn't solve re-renders)
  2. ❌ Removing redundant analysis (good optimization, doesn't fix core issues)
  3. ❌ Cursor/scroll preservation (band-aid over architectural problem)
  4. ❌ Moving state out of Zustand (breaks dependent features)
  5. ❌ Conditional set() calls (marginal improvement, fundamental flaw remains)

  Core Issue:

  The architecture assumes document replacement is cheap. It's not. Real-time editing requires incremental updates, but the system only does full synchronization. Every operation        
  triggers a full DocumentModel→Tiptap conversion, destroying formatting and causing disruption.

  Correct Solution (Not Implemented):

  Tiptap should be the single source of truth. DocumentModel should be a derived view for analysis, not the canonical editor state. Analysis results should update decorations only,      
  never replace content.
