APA Document Checker - Technical Summary

  What It Does

  An academic writing assistant that validates Word documents (.docx) against APA 7th edition guidelines. Students and researchers upload their papers and get instant feedback on formatting, citations,
  structure, and writing quality with automated fixes for common issues.

  How It Works

  Document Processing Flow

  1. Upload: User uploads .docx file through web interface
  2. Server Processing: LibreOffice converts document to HTML while preserving rich formatting data
  3. Analysis: Dual-layer validation system checks document:
    - Rule-based: Validates against 50+ specific APA requirements
    - AI-powered: Analyzes content quality and academic tone (optional)
  4. Interactive Feedback: Issues displayed in categorized panels with clickable highlighting
  5. Auto-Fix: One-click fixes for common formatting issues by modifying the original document
