● Real-Time Editor Architecture Audit Report

Executive Summary

Your application has successfully transitioned to a real-time editing architecture where Tiptap is the single source of truth during editing sessions. The implementation demonstrates solid understanding of reactive
patterns and separation of concerns, but several critical architectural flaws and implementation gaps threaten stability, data consistency, and user experience.

Overall Grade: C+ (Functional but Fragile)

---

Architecture Overview

Strengths

Single Source of Truth Pattern (Mostly Implemented)

- Tiptap editor successfully maintains primary document state during active editing sessions
- Passive observer hooks correctly avoid mutating editor content
- Transaction-based fix application prevents full content reloads
- Three-layer persistence strategy provides good data safety

Clean Separation of Concerns

- Auto-save hook operates independently without touching editor state
- Analysis runs in background without blocking UI
- Issue decorations are purely visual without mutating document
- Event-driven communication enables loose coupling between components

Progressive Enhancement Approach

- IndexedDB provides local-first editing experience
- Supabase sync happens asynchronously
- Graceful degradation when storage layers fail

---

Critical Architectural Flaws

1. Dual Source of Truth Inconsistency ⚠️ CRITICAL

Problem: Your architecture maintains TWO competing sources of truth that fall out of sync:

- DocumentModel stores the original uploaded document structure with paragraph-based indexing
- Tiptap Editor stores the current edited content with its own paragraph structure

Why This Breaks:

- Issue highlighting uses DocumentModel paragraph indices to locate text in Tiptap
- When user adds/removes paragraphs during editing, indices become misaligned
- Fix application searches DocumentModel paragraphs that no longer match Tiptap structure
- Analysis runs on Tiptap content but stores results with DocumentModel paragraph references

Evidence in Code:

- Highlighting failures show paragraph index mismatches consistently
- Fix application requires full document search as fallback because positions are wrong
- Console logs reveal "Paragraph search failed" followed by document-wide searches

Impact:

- Issues highlight in wrong locations
- Text fixes fail to find target content
- Performance degrades due to unnecessary full-document searches
- User confusion when highlighted text doesn't match issue description

Recommended Fix:
Either fully commit to Tiptap as source of truth and derive everything from it, OR implement bidirectional synchronization that updates DocumentModel structure when Tiptap changes. Current hybrid approach creates
maintenance nightmare.

---

2. setContent Violations Break Editor Control ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

Problem: Despite architectural goal of "no setContent after initial load," code contains THREE instances of setContent being called during editing:

- Formatting fix application uses full content refresh
- Document restoration from snapshots uses full content refresh
- Both operations destroy user's cursor position and selection state

Why This Breaks:
When setContent is called, ProseMirror completely replaces the document, causing:

- Cursor jumps to document start
- Active selections are lost
- Undo/redo history is cleared
- User loses context and must reorient themselves

Impact:

- Applying formatting fixes (font family/size) disrupts editing flow
- Undoing changes feels broken because cursor doesn't return to expected position
- Power users will notice and complain about jarring UX

Recommended Fix:
Formatting fixes should calculate ProseMirror transactions that surgically update node attributes. Document restoration should preserve cursor position by capturing selection before restore and reapplying after.

---

3. Race Conditions in Auto-Save and Analysis ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

Problem: Auto-save and analysis both debounce editor updates independently without coordination:

- Auto-save debounces 5 seconds
- Analysis debounces 8 seconds
- Both read editor content simultaneously
- No mutex or coordination mechanism exists

Why This Breaks:
User types continuously for 6 seconds:

- Second 5: Auto-save captures content snapshot
- Second 8: Analysis captures different content snapshot
- Auto-save completes first, saves to IndexedDB
- Auto-save triggers Supabase save after 5 more seconds
- Analysis completes, updates issues based on different content
- Issues now reference content that differs from saved version

Impact:

- After reload, issues might not match saved content
- Highlighting could fail because analyzed content differs from persisted content
- Subtle data inconsistencies accumulate over time

Recommended Fix:
Implement coordination mechanism where analysis reads from the same snapshot that auto-save persisted. Or make analysis trigger AFTER save completes to ensure consistency.

---

4. Missing Bidirectional Sync Between DocumentModel and Tiptap ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

Problem: Tiptap stores edited content but DocumentModel never learns about structural changes:

- User adds new paragraph in Tiptap
- DocumentModel still has old paragraph count
- User deletes paragraph in Tiptap
- DocumentModel retains deleted paragraph with stale content
- Analysis updates DocumentModel's IssueTracker but not paragraph structure

Why This Breaks:

- Fix application searches DocumentModel paragraphs that don't exist in Tiptap
- Issue positioning becomes increasingly inaccurate as edits accumulate
- DocumentModel statistics (word count, paragraph count) become stale and incorrect
- Export functionality would export wrong content because it reads from DocumentModel

Impact:

- Core functionality degrades over editing session duration
- Longer editing sessions = more broken functionality
- Export might produce document that differs from what user sees in editor

Recommended Fix:
Either eliminate DocumentModel during editing sessions (use it only for initial load), OR implement observer that syncs Tiptap changes back to DocumentModel structure in real-time.

---

5. Analysis Updates DocumentModel But Not Tiptap ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

Problem: Analysis hook updates DocumentModel's IssueTracker by clearing and repopulating Maps:

documentModel.issues.issues.clear();
documentModel.issues.paragraphIssues.clear();
newIssues.forEach(issue => documentModel.issues.addIssue(issue));

But Tiptap never knows about this. Issues are passed separately to decoration hook.

Why This Breaks:

- IssuesPanel reads from DocumentModel
- Tiptap decorations receive issues from analysis hook state
- Two different code paths with potential for divergence
- If one update fails, UI becomes inconsistent

Impact:

- Potential for IssuesPanel showing different issues than editor highlights
- Debugging becomes difficult when issue counts don't match across UI
- State management complexity increases unnecessarily

Recommended Fix:
Single source of truth for issues. Store issues EITHER in DocumentModel OR in hook state, not both. Derive all UI from that single source.

---

6. Incomplete Error Boundaries ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

Problem: Error boundaries exist but don't cover all failure scenarios:

- Analysis failure doesn't gracefully degrade highlighting
- Auto-save failure doesn't notify user of unsaved changes
- Fix application failure leaves processing state stuck
- Network failures during Supabase sync happen silently

Why This Breaks:
User has no feedback when silent failures occur. They continue editing thinking work is saved when it's not. Analysis failures leave stale issues visible.

Impact:

- Data loss when users assume auto-save worked
- Confusion when applying fix doesn't update highlights
- Trust issues when app behavior seems random

Recommended Fix:
Comprehensive error handling with user-visible notifications. Show save status indicator. Retry failed saves. Clear stale highlights when analysis fails.

---

7. Memory Management Concerns ⚠️ LOW PRIORITY (But Monitor)

Problem: Several potential memory leaks identified:

- Event listeners in StoreEventEmitter don't always clean up properly
- Analysis hook creates new analyzer instance but never disposes
- IndexedDB connections might not close on component unmount
- Snapshot system caps at 10 snapshots but snapshots contain full document clones

Why This Could Break:
Long editing sessions accumulate listeners, timeouts, and snapshots. Memory usage grows unbounded. Browser eventually slows or crashes.

Impact:

- Performance degradation over time
- Mobile devices with limited memory crash faster
- Power users with long documents experience issues

Recommended Fix:
Audit all useEffect cleanup functions. Implement weak references where appropriate. Consider compressed snapshots. Add memory profiling during development.

---

Specific Implementation Issues

Auto-Save Mechanism

What Works Well:

- Clean debouncing prevents excessive writes
- Two-layer strategy (IndexedDB + Supabase) provides redundancy
- Content comparison prevents unnecessary saves

Critical Issues:

- Supabase save scheduled with setTimeout creates detached async operation that might never complete if component unmounts
- No retry mechanism for failed saves
- No user notification when save fails
- No conflict resolution if multiple tabs edit same document

Improvement Needed:
Implement proper async/await chain, track save state, notify user of status, handle conflicts.

---

Analysis System

What Works Well:

- Immediate initial analysis provides fast feedback
- 8-second debounce balances responsiveness with performance
- EnhancedAPAAnalyzer produces comprehensive results

Critical Issues:

- Analysis reads from Tiptap but stores results with DocumentModel paragraph indices
- Paragraph indices from analysis don't match Tiptap structure after edits
- No incremental analysis despite INCREMENTAL_ANALYSIS feature flag existing
- Analysis blocks main thread (no Web Worker despite architecture claiming future support)

Improvement Needed:
Move to Web Worker, implement true incremental analysis, store issue positions using Tiptap's position system not paragraph indices.

---

Issue Highlighting

What Works Well:

- Decoration-based highlighting doesn't mutate content
- Fallback search strategies catch most edge cases
- Visual severity coding helps user prioritize

Critical Issues:

- Relies on stale paragraph indices from DocumentModel
- Extensive fallback searching indicates fundamental positioning problem
- Debug logs show consistent "paragraph search failed" followed by document-wide search
- Performance degrades when many issues require full document search
- Some issues never highlight because text can't be found

Improvement Needed:
Store issue positions using ProseMirror's position system from the start. Calculate positions during analysis based on Tiptap structure, not DocumentModel.

---

Fix Application

What Works Well:

- Transaction-based text replacement preserves editor state
- Search fallback mechanism eventually finds most text
- Event-driven communication decouples fix logic from UI

Critical Issues:

- Recent fix removed DocumentModel validation but didn't address root cause
- Search fallback is workaround for broken position calculation
- Formatting fixes still use setContent causing cursor jumps
- No feedback when fix can't find text to replace
- Fix success doesn't trigger re-analysis to remove fixed issue highlighting

Improvement Needed:
Calculate correct positions from start, eliminate search fallback, fix formatting fixes to use transactions, trigger re-analysis after fix.

---

Data Persistence

What Works Well:

- Three-layer architecture provides excellent data safety
- Timestamp comparison prevents overwriting newer data with older
- IndexedDB provides instant local saves

Critical Issues:

- Tiptap JSON and DocumentModel can diverge, leading to two different versions of "current document"
- No conflict resolution if user edits in multiple tabs
- No indication to user which version they're seeing
- Export functionality might use stale DocumentModel instead of current Tiptap content

Improvement Needed:
Explicit versioning, conflict resolution UI, clear indication of data source, export from Tiptap not DocumentModel.

Conclusion

Your real-time editing architecture demonstrates solid foundations with clean separation of concerns and passive observer patterns. However, the dual source of truth between DocumentModel and Tiptap creates cascading  
 issues throughout the system. Most bugs and workarounds trace back to this fundamental inconsistency.

The application is functional but fragile. It works for basic use cases but edge cases reveal architectural tensions. As editing sessions lengthen and users make more structural changes, issues accumulate. Current
workarounds (search fallbacks, document-wide searches, validation skipping) mask symptoms without addressing root causes.

Primary Recommendation: Commit to either Tiptap-only architecture (eliminate DocumentModel during editing) or implement robust bidirectional synchronization. Half-measures perpetuate current issues and make codebase  
 harder to maintain.

● Strategic Recommendation: Simplified Tiptap-First Architecture

Based on your goals of preserving formatting, maintaining real-time editing, reducing complexity, and ensuring a concrete architecture, here's my recommendation:

Recommendation: Eliminate DocumentModel During Editing Sessions

Why This Approach?

Aligns With Your Current Working State

- You've already achieved cursor stability and no document jumping
- Save functionality works reliably
- Users have seamless editing experience
- These successes came from making Tiptap the source of truth

Reduces Complexity Dramatically

- Single source of truth = single code path to maintain
- No synchronization logic needed
- No paragraph index translation required
- Fewer potential failure points

Preserves Formatting Better

- Tiptap already stores ALL formatting information in its JSON structure
- Your TiptapDocumentConverter successfully captures fonts, spacing, indentation, runs
- DocumentModel becomes unnecessary middleman that can drift from reality

Proposed Architecture

Three-Phase Document Lifecycle

Phase 1: Upload & Initial Conversion (Keep as-is)

- User uploads DOCX
- Server processes with XmlDocxProcessor
- Extracts rich formatting data
- TiptapDocumentConverter transforms to Tiptap JSON
- Store original DOCX buffer for export needs

Phase 2: Editing Session (Simplify - NEW)

- Tiptap JSON is the ONLY source of truth
- All operations read from and write to Tiptap
- Analysis analyzes Tiptap content directly
- Issues store positions using ProseMirror's absolute position system
- Auto-save persists Tiptap JSON only

Phase 3: Export & Persistence (Streamline)

- Export generates DOCX from current Tiptap JSON
- No DocumentModel reconstruction needed
- Original formatting metadata travels with Tiptap JSON

Concrete Implementation Plan

What to Keep

1. Tiptap Editor with Custom Extensions - Already working perfectly
2. Auto-Save Hook - Functions correctly as passive observer
3. Issue Decorations - Visual-only highlighting works well
4. Three-Layer Persistence - IndexedDB → Supabase → Export
5. Event-Driven Communication - Clean decoupling between components
6. Transaction-Based Fix Application - Preserves cursor position

What to Remove

1. DocumentModel class during active editing (keep only for initial conversion)
2. Paragraph-based indexing (use ProseMirror positions)
3. Dual state synchronization logic
4. DocumentService analysis methods that interact with DocumentModel
5. IssueTracker Map structures (replace with simple array in Zustand)

What to Change

1. Analysis Architecture


    - EnhancedAPAAnalyzer receives Tiptap JSON directly
    - Returns issues with ProseMirror positions (calculated during analysis)
    - No DocumentModel involvement

2. Issue Storage


    - Store issues in Zustand state as simple array
    - Each issue contains: { id, title, description, severity, category, position: { from, to }, hasFix, fixData }
    - Position is absolute ProseMirror position, not paragraph index

3. Fix Application


    - Remove DocumentModel search and validation
    - Use issue's stored position directly
    - If position is stale (content changed), search locally near position
    - All fixes use ProseMirror transactions (including formatting)

4. State Management


    - Simplified Zustand store structure
    - Remove all DocumentModel-related state
    - Keep only: { tiptapContent, issues, processingState, metadata }

Data Flow (Simplified)

Upload Flow
DOCX Upload → Server Processing → Rich Data Extraction →
Tiptap Conversion → Store in Zustand → Render in Editor →
Initial Analysis → Issues with PM Positions → Decorations

Editing Flow
User Types → Tiptap Update Event →
Auto-Save (Debounced 5s) → IndexedDB + Supabase →
Analysis (Debounced 8s) → New Issues Array →
Update Decorations (Visual Only)

Fix Application Flow
User Clicks Fix → Read Issue Position →
Create PM Transaction → Dispatch to Editor →
Remove Issue from Array → Update Decorations →
Trigger Re-Analysis (Debounced)

Export Flow
User Requests Export → Read Current Tiptap JSON →
Generate DOCX with Formatting → Download

How This Solves Your Problems

Eliminates Dual Source of Truth

- Only Tiptap exists during editing
- No synchronization needed
- No paragraph index mismatches
- No stale data issues

Preserves Formatting Perfectly

- Tiptap JSON already contains all formatting metadata
- Custom extensions store font, size, spacing, indentation
- Export reads from same source user sees
- No information loss between states

Maintains Real-Time Editing

- Current working behavior unchanged
- Still using transactions for updates
- Still avoiding setContent after initial load
- Cursor stability maintained

Reduces Complexity

- Fewer classes to maintain
- Single code path for operations
- Easier to reason about data flow
- Fewer edge cases to handle

Improves Performance

- No document-wide fallback searches needed
- Direct position lookups always succeed
- Less memory consumption (no duplicate structures)
- Faster analysis (simpler data model)

What About Original Document Structure?

For Analysis Needs

- Store minimal metadata with Tiptap JSON: { originalFormatting, documentDefaults, pageSetup }
- Analysis reads this metadata plus Tiptap content
- No full DocumentModel needed

For Export Needs

- Keep original DOCX buffer in compressed form
- Export engine reads Tiptap JSON + formatting metadata
- Generates fresh DOCX with user's edits applied
- Falls back to original buffer's styles for elements not in Tiptap

Migration Path (Minimal Disruption)

Step 1: Add Position Calculation to Analysis (1-2 days)

- Modify EnhancedAPAAnalyzer to calculate ProseMirror positions
- Have it accept Tiptap JSON and editor instance
- Return issues with absolute positions instead of paragraph indices
- Test that positions correctly identify text

Step 2: Update Issue Highlighting (1 day)

- Modify IssueHighlighter to use absolute positions
- Remove paragraph index search logic
- Remove document-wide fallback (no longer needed)
- Verify highlighting accuracy improves

Step 3: Simplify Fix Application (1 day)

- Use issue positions directly
- Remove DocumentModel search logic
- Convert formatting fixes to transactions (no more setContent)
- Test all fix types work correctly

Step 4: Streamline State Management (2 days)

- Remove DocumentModel from Zustand store
- Keep minimal metadata object
- Update all consumers to read from Tiptap
- Verify save/load still works

Step 5: Clean Up Dead Code (1 day)

- Remove unused DocumentModel methods
- Remove synchronization logic
- Remove paragraph index utilities
- Update documentation

Total Effort: ~1 week of focused work

Risk Mitigation

Preserve Current Working State

Long Term

- Maintainability dramatically improves
- Testing becomes easier
- Export reliability increases
- User trust grows

Final Recommendation

Go with Tiptap-First Architecture

You've already done the hard work of making Tiptap the source of truth. You're 80% there. The remaining 20% is removing the DocumentModel crutch that's causing most of your bugs.

Your instincts were right: the real-time editing architecture is the correct direction. Now complete the transition by removing the legacy DocumentModel from the editing lifecycle.

This gives you:

- ✅ Preserved formatting (Tiptap JSON is comprehensive)
- ✅ Real-time editing (already working)
- ✅ Reduced complexity (single source of truth)
- ✅ Concrete architecture (clear three-phase lifecycle)
- ✅ Maintainable codebase (easier to reason about)

The path forward is clear, achievable in a week, and builds on what's already working rather than introducing new complexity.
