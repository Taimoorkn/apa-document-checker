## Timeline Expectations

- **First signs of re-indexing**: 1-3 days
- **Full re-indexing**: 1-2 weeks
- **Rankings stabilize**: 2-4 weeks

## What I've Already Done

✅ Added "Lilo" to keywords while keeping "APA document checker"
✅ Updated description to include "Lilo is a..."
✅ Kept all existing APA-related keywords (maintains search relevance)
✅ Sitemap and robots.txt are already configured

## Why Your Site Will Rank Again

1. **Domain hasn't changed** - You're still on `apa-document-checker.vercel.app`
2. **Content is still relevant** - All APA-related content is intact
3. **Technical SEO is solid** - Sitemap, robots.txt, meta tags all in place
4. **Keywords overlap** - We kept "APA document checker" in keywords

## Quick Wins to Boost Re-indexing

### A. Add Internal Links
Make sure your landing page links to:
- `/signup`
- `/login`
- `/dashboard`
(Already done with navigation)

### B. Share on Social Media
- Post the new URL on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook
- Each share creates a backlink that Google will crawl

### C. Get Backlinks
- Submit to directories:
  - Product Hunt
  - BetaList
  - Indie Hackers
- Reddit posts in relevant subreddits (r/AcademicWriting, r/CollegeHomeworkTips)

## Monitoring Recovery

Check daily in Google Search Console:
1. **Coverage** - Should show pages being indexed
2. **Performance** - Will show impressions/clicks returning
3. **URL Inspection** - Check if pages are "Indexed"

## If Still Not Showing After 2 Weeks

1. Check for crawl errors in Search Console
2. Verify robots.txt allows Google: `https://apa-document-checker.vercel.app/robots.txt`
3. Check if site is accidentally set to "noindex"
4. Contact Google Search Console support

## Current SEO Status

✅ Sitemap: Live at `/sitemap.xml`
✅ Robots.txt: Live at `/robots.txt`
✅ Meta tags: Optimized with Lilo + APA keywords
✅ OpenGraph: Updated for social sharing
✅ JSON-LD: Structured data in place
✅ Mobile-friendly: Responsive design
✅ Fast loading: Next.js optimization

Your site WILL come back. It's just a matter of Google re-crawling. The metadata changes don't remove your site - they just need to be re-indexed.
