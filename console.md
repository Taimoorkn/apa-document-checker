    - Changed to: textBeforeMatch.split('\n').length
    - Fixes off-by-one error where all headings were indexed 1 paragraph too early

  2. src/hooks/useUnifiedDocumentEditor.js
  - ✅ Line 101: triggerAnalysis destructured from useAnalysis hook (already existed)
  - ✅ Line 302: Added shouldReanalyze flag at start of fix handler
  - ✅ Line 402: Set shouldReanalyze = true after text replacement transaction
  - ✅ Line 404-405: Removed position mapping code (lines deleted, not needed with immediate re-analysis)
  - ✅ Line 461: Set shouldReanalyze = true after formatting fix transaction
  - ✅ Lines 470-478: Added immediate re-analysis trigger after fix
    - Calls triggerAnalysis() after 100ms delay
    - Prevents stale issue IDs
    - Fixes consecutive fix application bug
  - ✅ Line 482: Added triggerAnalysis to dependency array
  - ✅ Line 526: triggerAnalysis exported from hook (return value)

  3. src/hooks/useAnalysis.js
  - ✅ Line 128: Console log updated to show "2s" instead of "8s"
  - ✅ Line 134: Debounce reduced from 8000ms to 2000ms
    - Comment updated: "2 second debounce - responsive while preventing analysis spam"

  4. src/hooks/useAutoSave.js
  - ✅ Line 12-14: Variable names updated:
    - Removed: saveTimeoutRef
    - Added: debounceTimeoutRef (300ms batching timer)
    - Removed: supabaseSaveAbortRef
    - Added: activeSaveAbortRef (tracks entire save operation)
  - ✅ Lines 27-33: Abort-first architecture implemented
    - Aborts in-flight saves before starting new debounce
    - Prevents race conditions
  - ✅ Line 28: Debounce reduced from 5000ms to 300ms (16x faster)
  - ✅ Lines 46-48: AbortController created for entire save operation

    - Now executes immediately after IndexedDB
    - Added .abortSignal(abortController.signal) (line 75)
    - Proper AbortError handling (lines 82-83)
  - ✅ Lines 102-108: Cleanup updated to use new variable names

  Exports & Dependencies Verified

  useAnalysis hook:
  - ✅ Returns: { issues, isAnalyzing, triggerAnalysis }
  - ✅ triggerAnalysis used in useUnifiedDocumentEditor.js line 476
  - ✅ Properly added to dependency array line 482

  useAutoSave hook:
  - ✅ No exports changed (still default export)
  - ✅ All internal refs updated consistently

  Code Consistency Checks

  ✅ Variable naming: All renamed variables used consistently throughout files
  ✅ Function signatures: No breaking changes to exports
  ✅ Dependencies: All React hook dependencies updated correctly
  ✅ Comments: Updated to reflect new timing values
  ✅ Error handling: Abort errors properly caught and logged

  Performance Impact Summary

  | Change             | Before  | After  | Improvement      |

  | Fix re-analysis    | None    | 100ms  | Instant feedback |

  Critical Fixes

  1. ✅ Off-by-one paragraph index - Fixed in enhancedApaAnalyzer.js
  2. ✅ Multi-line heading detection - Fixed in enhancedApaAnalyzer.js
  3. ✅ Consecutive fix failures - Fixed via immediate re-analysis
  4. ✅ Auto-save race conditions - Fixed with AbortController

  Known Issues

  ⚠️ Browser cache: Old code (supabaseSaveAbortRef) may be cached
  - Solution: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
  - Verification: Error should reference activeSaveAbortRef not supabaseSaveAbortRef
