Running head: TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY

ABSTRACT
This summary is painfully short and offers only a vague promise.

INTRODUCTION
Technology has changed society drastically over the years. "This quotation is intentionally far too long to remain inline because it stretches well past forty carefully counted words while still wearing quotation marks and lacking any citation afterwards, which should definitely be a block quote. This unnecessarily extended statement keeps rambling to ensure the threshold is exceeded for testing." The transition to digital learning was noted (Smith 2020) during the pandemic, and another study (Jones and White, 2021) insisted on new strategies while (Johnson, et al., 2019) suggested flexibility.

This paragraph references a social thread by @PolicyGuru on Twitter about campus policies. It also cites Brown v. Board of Education 347 U.S. 483 (1954) as a reminder of how precedent matters in education. For further reading, see the Paper presented at the Conference on Emerging Research in Student Learning where no location was provided.

METHOD
Students reported stress related to long numeric explanations such as E = mc^2 + 2ab - 4c + (d/e) + (f*g) + (h-i) + (j/k) which should have been displayed differently. The data were explained in supplemental material file that readers will somehow find later. Detailed documentation lives in Supplementary material table three for motivated readers.

According to the dean, "This moderately lengthy quotation contains around thirty two carefully chosen words to trigger the inline threshold properly while still staying under forty while also reminding everyone that policy revisions demand patience." Faculty members considered the recommendation carefully.

    "This indented block quote is also intentionally wrapped in quotation marks even though it stretches across multiple sentences and therefore should not keep the marks if it were properly formatted according to APA." It continues without any immediate citation afterwards which is another problem.

Another paragraph includes footnotes like this bracketed marker[1] and another citation marker[2] followed by more commentary with yet another marker[3] before we add one more to make sure[4] the detector notices the excessive use.

RESULTS
The outcomes demonstrated growth. Participants read that $$ y = mx + b $$ was the guiding model.

DISCUSSION
The research implies administrators should review supplementary material references carefully.

In addition, participants noted a series of actions:
- Draft the report with mixed punctuation.
- Review funding sources
- Submit the document on time.

Participants also recorded in a numbered list:
1. Gather responses.
3. Analyze themes.
2. Write conclusions.
